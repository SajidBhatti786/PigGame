# PigGame

PigGame is a simple web-based game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to score a target number of points before your opponent.

## Rules

- The game is played with a pair of dice.
- Two players take turns rolling the dice.
- On each turn, a player can roll the dice as many times as desired and accumulate points.
- However, if a player rolls a 1 on either die, their turn ends and they lose all points accumulated during that turn.
- To save their points and end their turn, a player can choose to "Hold".
- The accumulated points are added to the player's total score.
- The first player to reach the target score wins the game.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PigGame.git`

2. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to start the game.

## Game Settings

- **Winning Score**: The target score that a player needs to reach to win the game. By default, it is set to 100 points.
- **Player Names**: You can set the names of the two players before starting the game.

## Game Controls

- **Hold**: Click the "Hold" button to save the accumulated points and end your turn.
